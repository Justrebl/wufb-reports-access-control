# WUfB Reports Access Control

## Overview

This solution deploys WUfB reports infrastructure for partioning data and securing access using Azure RBAC. As an administrator you can define one or more *scopes* to indicate that records for a given Azure AD group of devices should be exported from the tenant workspace to a scoped workspace that can be secured using Azure RBAC.

The `ansible` folder of the project contains an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbook which, after configuration, can deploy the necessary infrastructure to your Azure tenant.

At the high-level, this includes the following resources:

1. Azure resources
   1. [Resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) to contain resources generated by the automation
   2. [Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) triggered on an interval to perform periodic data export
2. Log Analytics resources
   1. [Log Analytics workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview) for each scope
3. Azure Monitor resources
   1. [Data collection endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-endpoint-overview) ingesting data
   2. [Data collection rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-collection-rule-overview) for each scoped workspace to direct data routing

All access groups will use the same Azure Monitor Workbook. WUfB reports has been updated to provide a drop-down workspace chooser.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/attachments/wufb-reports-access-control-architecture.drawio.png)

## Permissions required for deployment

The user or [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) running the automation to deploy infrastructure should be an Azure subscription [Owner](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) to ensure necessary providers and resources can be enabled automatically.

## Authorization

### Create a service principal

### Authorize service principal for subscription

- Access control (IAM)
  - Add role assignment. Needs Owner to have permission to assign RBAC to other resources created.

### Authorize service principal for Graph APIs

- Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy
- GroupMember.Read.All

### Generate client secret

### Add credentials file

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_azure.html#storing-in-a-file

```ini
[default]
subscription_id=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
client_id=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
tenant=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Ansible

### Install Azure collection and pre-requisites

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection
pip install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/azure/azcollection/requirements-azure.txt
```

### Install Node.js 18

### Install Azure function core tools

https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools

#### Windows

```bash
npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
```

#### Mac

```bash
brew tap azure/functions
brew install azure-functions-core-tools@4
```

### Login to Azure

- For authentication with Azure you can pass parameters, set environment variables, use a profile stored in ~/.azure/credentials, or log in before you run your tasks or playbook with `az login`.
- Authentication is also possible using a service principal or Active Directory user.
- To authenticate via service principal, pass subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or set environment variables AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_SECRET and AZURE_TENANT.
- To authenticate via Active Directory user, pass ad_user and password, or set AZURE_AD_USER and AZURE_PASSWORD in the environment.
- Alternatively, credentials can be stored in `~/.azure/credentials`. This is an ini file containing a `[default]` section and the following keys: subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or subscription_id, ad_user and password. It is also possible to add additional profiles. Specify the profile by passing profile or setting AZURE_PROFILE in the environment.

### Configure secure vars

Add `scope_connector_credentials.yml` to `secure_vars`.

### Customize host vars

Customize scopes and other vars in `host_vars/localhost`.

### Run the playbook

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
```

### Waiting for resources to be ready

```yaml
    - name: Wait for namespace to be ready
      azure_rm_resource_facts:
        api_version: '2017-04-01'
        resource_group: "{{ resource_group }}"
        provider: eventhub
        resource_type: namespaces
        resource_name: "{{ namespacename }}"
      register: output
      until: output.response[0].properties.status == 'Active'
      delay: 10
```
